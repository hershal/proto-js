# Proto-JS

These are small-scale prototypes for whatever I'm working on. There might be
some cool stuff in here, so be sure to poke around!

To run any of the prototypes, navigate to the subdirectory of interest and run
`npm install` and then run `node index.js`.

Each subdirectory here is a small package, complete with its own `package.json`,
`index.js` entry point, and dependencies. I didn't want to extract out each
prototype into its own tiny package and repository because these prototypes do
nothing by themselves -- they're just small prototypes for a larger application
that I'm working on. I also didn't want to make the entire repository a package
because I wanted a blank slate for each prototype. This structure seemed to be
the best compromise.

Happy hacking!
