# GPU Status Monitor

![GPU Status Monitor Example](http://imgur.com/oTZNztF.gif)

This is a very basic tool to get the operation status of an NVIDIA GPU running
on Linux using `nvidia-smi`. I wanted to see if my GPU was actually doing any
work while training some neural networks, so I cooked up this tool. It seemed
useful enough to extract it out of `/tmp` so I saved it here.
